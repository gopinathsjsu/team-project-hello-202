XP Values: Communication

How the team kept the core value? <br>
Team meetings in which diagrams were made to convey the structure of the tables in the back-end and mock-ups of how the front-end will look like on Figma. <br>
Every Standup includes discussing the work done, the challenges and whether there is any deviation in the implementation from the diagrams and mockups.
